## Repacked

A lightweight Fabric mod that eliminates the annoying Reloading Resource Packs screen by reloading packs asynchronously in the background â€” keeping your experience fluid and uninterrupted.

But thatâ€™s not all â€” it also introduces a Pack Profile system that lets you automatically link specific resource packs to individual singleplayer worlds or multiplayer servers. When you join, those packs are applied. When you leave, theyâ€™re removed. Simple, smart, and seamless.
